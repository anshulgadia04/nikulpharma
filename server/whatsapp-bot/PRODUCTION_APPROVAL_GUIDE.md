# 🚀 WhatsApp Business API - Production Access Guide

## 🔴 Current Limitation (Development Mode)

Your WhatsApp Business API is currently in **TEST/DEVELOPMENT MODE**, which means:

❌ **You can ONLY send messages to:**
- Phone numbers registered as "Test Recipients" in Meta Developer Dashboard
- Usually 5-10 numbers maximum
- You must manually add each test number in the dashboard

✅ **In PRODUCTION MODE, you can send to:**
- ANY phone number in the world
- Unlimited recipients
- All your customers automatically

---

## 📋 Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Add Test Numbers (Temporary - For Testing)

**Steps:**

4. Click "**Manage phone number list**" or "**Add recipient phone number**"
5. Add phone numbers you want to test with (up to 5-10 numbers)
6. Each number must verify via SMS/WhatsApp OTP

**Limitations:**

#### Step 3: Request Message Template Approval

Before going live, you need approved message templates:

1. Go to: **WhatsApp Manager** → **Message Templates**
2. Create templates for:
   - Inquiry acknowledgment
   - Product inquiry confirmation  
   - Quote request confirmation
   
**Example Template:**

```
Template Name: inquiry_acknowledgment
Category: UTILITY (for transactional messages)
Language: English

Message:
Hello {{1}},

Thank you for contacting Nikul Pharma!

We have received your inquiry (ID: {{2}}) and our team will review it shortly.

Expected Response: Within 2-4 hours

For urgent matters: +91 6375591682
```

**Variables:**
- {{1}} = Customer name
- {{2}} = Inquiry ID

**Timeline:** 1-2 business days for approval

#### Step 4: Request Production Access

1. Go to: **WhatsApp Manager** → **API Setup**
2. Look for "**Request Production Access**" or "**Go Live**"
3. You'll need:
   - ✅ Verified business
   - ✅ Complete business profile
   - ✅ At least 1 approved message template
   - ✅ Display name approved
   
4. Submit the request

**Timeline:** 1-3 business days

#### Step 5: Messaging Limits

Once in production, you'll have messaging limits that increase with usage:

- **Tier 1** (Initial): 1,000 messages/24 hours
- **Tier 2**: 10,000 messages/24 hours  
- **Tier 3**: 100,000 messages/24 hours
- **Tier 4**: Unlimited

Limits increase automatically based on:
- Quality rating (how many users block/report you)
- Message volume
- Low spam complaints

## 🔧 Option 3: Use Template Messages (Works in Test Mode)

Even in test mode, **approved template messages** can sometimes be sent to more numbers.

Update your code to use template messages instead of free-form text:

```javascript
// Instead of sending custom text
await whatsappService.sendTextMessage(phone, "Your custom message");

// Use approved templates
await whatsappService.sendTemplateMessage(
  phone,
  'inquiry_acknowledgment',  // template name
  'en_US',                    // language
  [
    {
      type: 'body',
      parameters: [
        { type: 'text', text: customerName },
        { type: 'text', text: inquiryId }
      ]
    }
  ]
);
```
