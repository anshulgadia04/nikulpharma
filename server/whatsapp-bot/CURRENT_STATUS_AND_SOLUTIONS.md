## 🔴 Current Issues (Both Easy to Fix)

### Issue 1: Access Token Expired (Error 190)

**Problem:** Your WhatsApp access token has expired.

**Error Message:**
```
❌ You cannot access the app till you log in to www.facebook.com
   and follow the instructions given. (Code: 190)
```

**Fix (5 minutes):**

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/
2. Login → Select your app
3. Left sidebar → WhatsApp → Getting Started (or API Setup)
4. Find "Temporary access token" section
5. Click "Generate token" or "Copy"
6. Update your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=paste_your_new_token_here
   ```
7. Restart your server (Ctrl+C, then `npm start`)

**Done!** ✅

### Issue 2: Test Mode Restriction (Can't Send to Any Number)

**Problem:** Your WhatsApp Business API is in **TEST MODE**

**What this means:**
- ❌ You can ONLY send to phone numbers registered in Meta Dashboard
- ❌ Limited to 5-10 test recipients
- ❌ Cannot send to random customer phone numbers
- ✅ This is Meta's spam prevention during development

**Why you see the error:**
When someone fills the form with phone `9602021473`, the bot tries to send a WhatsApp message to that number. But that number is NOT registered as a test recipient in your Meta Dashboard, so Meta blocks it.

---

## ✅ Solutions (Choose One)

### Option A: Add Test Numbers (Quick - For Testing Only)

**Best for:** Testing the bot with a few specific phone numbers

**Steps:**

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/
2. Login → Your App → WhatsApp → API Setup
3. Find the "To" field (where you test messages)
4. Click "**Manage phone number list**"
5. Click "**Add phone number**"
6. Enter phone: `+919602021473` (or your number)
7. Click "Send Code" → Enter OTP received on WhatsApp
8. Verify ✅

**Repeat for each test number (max 5-10)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick (5 minutes)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Good for testing

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only works for specific numbers
- ❌ Not suitable for production
- ❌ Can't send to actual customers
